<p align="center"> - The open head tracker - </p>

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/18wa4pqqsge9m0x3?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/AIRLegend/aitracker)


## What is this?

AITrack is a 6-Degree of Freedom headtracker designed to work alongside [Opentrack](https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack) for its use in simulators/games. 

AITrack uses its own tracking pipeline (based on neural networks) to estimate the user's head position with respect to the webcam and then, streams it to Opentrack, which in turn, transmits it to your games.

### Main features

* Hardware (IR LEDs, specific hardware...) free headtracking solution.
* Good performance under poor light conditions.
* Good detection with partial face occlusion (using glasses).
* Reasonable low CPU percentage consumption.
* Remote-running capability. You can use a second PC (for example, a laptop)to stream the tracking data to your main machine.

## Installing and running

1. Download and install [Visual C++ Redistributable x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) in case you don't already have it.
2. Download Opentrack from [Opentrack's releases page](https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack/releases)
2. Download the most recent version of the tracker from the [releases page](https://github.com/AIRLegend/aitracker/releases) (.zip file) and extract its content.
4. Run Opentrack and make sure to select Input = **UDP over network**, then, click "Start". Opentrack then will be for the data AITrack will send.
5. Run `AITrack.exe` from AITrack and click "Start tracking". 
6. Look around!

### But... I don't have a webcam :(

No problem. This program supports [Droid Cam](https://www.dev47apps.com/), so you're able to use your smartphone as a camera.

### My webcam is too old

Don't worry. AITrack supports low resolutions pretty well. Anything achieving at least 30fps and 480p will do the job fine.

**IMPORTANT:**
In case you want to know more, please, head to the [project's wiki](https://github.com/AIRLegend/aitrack/wiki) to find guides about usage. If you can't find there what you're looking for, feel free to post your question on the [issues page](https://github.com/AIRLegend/aitracker/issues).

**Thanks to Sims Smith**, who made a [video tutorial on how to setting up AITrack (v0.4)](https://youtu.be/LPlahUVPx4o) and **Stream Flight**, with a [tutorial for v0.5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMIwUg8NAlg). You can check them out.

**ALSO IMPORTANT AND NOT COVERED IN THE VIDEO TUTORIALS**

>Because of v0.4 is an older version, several punctualizations have to be made:
>1) You don't need to configure "Use remote client" anymore if you're running Opentrack in your local machine.
>2) You should take you time for [tweaking your curves in Opentrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0TBI7SoGkc) to your preferences.
>3) Experiment with Opentrack's built in filters. Acella it's the recommended one at the moment. Configure it's smoothing parameter to reduce camera shaking.
